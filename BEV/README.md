# Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) System Model

This is an abstract BEV system model, designed for vehicle system level analysis
such electric efficiency analysis.
The BEV model (`BEV_system_model.mdl`) consists of the following components.

- [Longitudinal vehicle][readme-veh] (`Vehicle1D`)
- [Reducder][readme-reducer] (`Reducer`)
- [Motor drive unit][readme-mdu] (`MotorDriveUnit`)
- [High voltage battery][readme-hvbatt] (`BatteryHV`)
- [Controller and environment][readme-ctrlenv] (`CtrlEnv`)
