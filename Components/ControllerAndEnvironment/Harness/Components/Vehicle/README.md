# Simplistic vehicle model for testing

This is a highly abstract model of system-level longitudinal road vehicle,
which is intended for use in testing the Controller and Environment component.
This component is not suitable for other purposes.

The model consists of three independent submodels -
geartrain and longitudinal vehicle dynamics,
motor temperature dynamics,
and high voltage battery temperature dynamics.
Vehicle dynamics and temperature dynamics are not linked
in this model.
