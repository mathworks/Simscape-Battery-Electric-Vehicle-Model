%% High Voltage Battery - Main Script
% This is a component to simulate the abstract dynamics of a high voltage battery 
% pack.
%% Models
% This component provides four models of a high voltage battery:
%% 
% * *Basic* model ... is the simplest model and computes the voltage and current 
% of the battery with no temperature dependence.
% * *Simple system* model ... is the second simplest model, built with <https://www.mathworks.com/help/sdl/ref/batterysystemlevel.html 
% Battery (System-Level) block> from Simscape Driveline. This model has a simple 
% equation-based terminal voltage model computed from the state of charge (SOC). 
% This model also computes the battery temperature from dissipated energy.
% * *System* model ... is a model built with <https://www.mathworks.com/help/sps/ref/battery.html 
% Battery block> from Simscape Battery and Simscape Electrical. This model can 
% simulate the terminal voltage more accurately than the simple system model above, 
% but it requires more parameters. Optionally, this model can also simulate charging 
% dynamics, fade, and aging.
% * *Table-based system* model ... is a model built with <https://www.mathworks.com/help/sps/ref/batterytablebased.html 
% Battery (Table-Based) block> from Simscape Battery and Simscape Electrical. 
% This model takes tabulated data for open-circuit voltage and terminal resistance 
% as a function of temperature and SOC. This model also needs the number of cells 
% and their series-parallel circuit configuration information. Similar to the 
% system model above, this model can optionally simulate charging dynamics, fade, 
% and aging.
%% Simulation cases
% To validate the component, a harness model is used to run some simulation 
% cases. Click the links below to see the simulation results.

% * <matlab:openFile('BatteryHV_simulationCase_Charge') Charging>
% * <matlab:openFile('BatteryHV_simulationCase_Discharge') Discharging>
% * <matlab:openFile('BatteryHV_simulationCase_Random') Random load current>
% * <matlab:openFile('BatteryHV_simulationCase_Constant') Constant load current>
