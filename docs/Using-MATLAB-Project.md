# Using MATLAB Project

The files and folders of the BEV model are managed
by [MATLAB project][url-mlprj].

[url-mlprj]: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/projects.html

With MATLAB Project,
you can manage MATLAB paths as [project paths][url-path]
relative to the project root folder,
which makes it easy to open or run scripts and models
anywhere in the project.

MATLAB Project analyzes dependecy relationships among files
registered in the project and helps you work with them.
For example, when you change the name of a MATLAB function
in the Project window (not in the Current Folder window),
the project finds locations in other files
where the function is called
and [automatically updates them][url-auto-update].

MATLAB Project supports source control tools
such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
For details, see the documentation
about [Source Control Integration][url-src-ctl].
